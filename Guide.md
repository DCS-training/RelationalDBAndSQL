**Databases and SQL a Self-Learn Guide**

# **Intro**

This is a short guide to help you finding good resources to learn the
basis of Databases and SQL.

The teaching is based on the combination of 2 video courses from
LinkedIn Learning.

The first one cover the theory of databases and it will give you the
basis you need to understand the principles of database and avoid the
main pitfalls, while the second is more practical.

Theory of databases

This part will help you familiarize with basics of relational database
design and how to prevent data anomalies. There is also a section on how
to plan your design and how to develop a conceptual data model
---translating your ideas into components like tables, relationships,
queries, and views.

Logical design considerations can help you construct a database that is
easy to maintain.

This conclude the first part of the pathway. All concept covered so far
can be applied to any Database system. The next section will get into
more detail on how to use SQL and SQLite.

**SQL Essential Training**

**SQL: Structured Query Language** is a domain-specific language used in
programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database
management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data
stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and
variables.

In this section you are going to learn how to use SQL to create tables,
define relationships, manipulate strings, numbers and dates. You will
also learn how to manipulate strings, number and dates, use triggers and
automate actions. Finally, you are going to see how to use sub-select
and views.

The video class uses Xamp to create the database and perform the tasks.
However, there are easier approaches and you can use other IDE
(Integrated Development Environment) to perform the same tasks. A good
and portable tool to do so is [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
You can also find more help on how to use DB browser in
[this](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-socialsci//index.html) and
[this](https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/) SQL training.
